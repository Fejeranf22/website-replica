				<h1>Anatomy of Elephants</h1>
        <p>
          Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals.
           African elephants stand 3–4 m (10–13 ft) and weigh 4,000–7,000 kg
            (8,800–15,400 lb) while Asian elephants stand 2–3.5 m (7–11 ft) and weigh
             3,000–5,000 kg (6,600–11,000 lb).[9] In both cases, males are larger than
             females.[10][13] Among African elephants, the forest form is smaller than
             the savannah form.[17] The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.
             [54] The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's
              flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants
               have 19 or 20 pairs.[55]



							 An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.[56] The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy.[54] Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.[42] Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.[57] Elephants are considered dichromats[58] and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light.[59] The core body temperature averages 35.9 °C (97 °F), similar to a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.[60]
